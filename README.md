I'm pursuing B.Tech. in Engineering Physics from Delhi Technological University with a GPA of 7.84. I have hands-on experience in internships at Visual Alpha and Genesis Virtue, where I used ReactJS, PHP, WordPress, and Elementor.

I have created two web applications, "IT'S YOUR STORY" and "Your Travel Guide", using ReactJS, Firebase, and Google Maps API. I'm proficient in languages like C/C++, Python, and JavaScript.

I have excelled in academic subjects, got selected for the Amazon ML Summer School '22, and solved more than 500 problems on LeetCode. I'm also interested in cricket and emerging technologies.

I'm looking forward to enhancing my skills and knowledge in software development.
