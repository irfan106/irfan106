Hello everyone, I am Irfan pursuing my B.tech from Delhi Technological University. I started development thinking that it was the tool that could help me change the world. In my journey, discovered many languages, people, and technologies and built products with some amazing people. I started development using python and flask and I created some websites with them, then I switched to ReactJs and NodeJs and also explored a lot of technologies and fields like data analysis and machine learning.
